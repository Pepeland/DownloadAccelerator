# Download Accelerator

This is a download accelerator application developed as a practice project for concurrency and multithreading in C#. The application aims to improve download speeds by utilizing techniques like segmented downloading and concurrent downloading.

## Features
- Segmenting large files into smaller segments for concurrent downloading
- Downloading segments concurrently to improve download speeds
- Combining the downloaded segments to reconstruct the complete file
- Progress tracking for individual segments

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run Debug or Release version Or
3. Open the project in your preferred C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
4. Build the solution.
5. Run the application to start the download accelerator.

3. Select destination folder
4. Configure the number of segments and other settings as needed.
5. Start the download.
6. Monitor the progress of each segment and the overall download progress.
7. Once the download is complete, the file will be saved to the specified location.
